{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"refined-web-experience","contentHtml":"<p>Recently, I've adopted using some software that has made my web experience a bit better:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I'm ashamed to say but it's not until a week ago I subscribed to the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS feeds</a>. Based on a recommendation by <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31973036\">acemarke</a> (who's content has been of help in the web development front, e.g., read his <a href=\"https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/how-web-apps-work/\">How Web Apps Work</a> series on his blog), I decided on the <a href=\"https://bazqux.com/\">BazQux Reader</a>. It seems indispensable now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I've always been skeptical of password managers, i.e., how the client's encrypted passwords are stored on a third-party server kind-of-thing. But I surfacely knew there were local-centric password managers: it wasn't till yesterday that I started using <a href=\"https://keepassxc.org/\">KeePassXC</a>. Privacy is critical and it saves you some headspace and time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I started making use of uBlock Origin's (uBO) <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax\">filtering</a> options. In hopes of being more intentional, I've blocked over a hundred websites so far. There are other filtering options I plan to test and use.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","title":"a refined web experience","date":"2023-01-02"}},"__N_SSG":true}
