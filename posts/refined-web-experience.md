title: 'a refined web experience'

Recently, I've adopted using some software that has made my web experience a bit better:

1. I'm ashamed to say but it's not until a week ago I subscribed to the concept of [RSS feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS). Based on a recommendation by [acemarke](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31973036) (who's content has been of help in the web development front, e.g., read his [How Web Apps Work](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/how-web-apps-work/) series on his blog), I decided on the [BazQux Reader](https://bazqux.com/). It seems indispensable now.

2. I've always been skeptical of password managers, i.e., how the client's encrypted passwords are stored on a third-party server kind-of-thing. But I surfacely knew there were local-centric password managers: it wasn't till yesterday that I started using [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). Privacy is critical and it saves you some headspace and time.

3. I started making use of uBlock Origin's (uBO) [filtering](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax) options. In hopes of being more intentional, I've blocked over a hundred websites so far. There are other filtering options I plan to test and use.
