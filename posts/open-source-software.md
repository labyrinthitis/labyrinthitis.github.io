A gentle way to get into the Open Source Software (OSS) world is by contributing to a project's repository by focusing on something small like an editorial correction. I did so this past week: I made a [one-word correction](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43766#event-8009538581) on the [Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). 

Seemingly excessive, it's a good starter.
