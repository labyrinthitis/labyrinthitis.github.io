As a layman, I agree with the advocacy toward (Free) Open Source Software, (F)OSS as an acronym. 

A gentle way to get into the space is by contributing to your favorite project's open repository by way of focusing on something small like an editorial correction. I did so this past week: I made a [one-word correction](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/43766#event-8009538581) on the [Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). Seemingly excessive but a good starter.
