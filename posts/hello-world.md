Lately, I've been reading about OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) over on [HackerNews](https://hn.algolia.com/?q=chatgpt). I find it interesting, not necessarily fascinating. Although, it does inspire me to be curious about how the different facets of software work. As such, the beginning of this informal, technical blog is an attempt to become somewhat versed.

I certainly have an affinity to specific areas of software, e.g., the web. A large focus will then lie in the web development domain. But ultimately, expect to see anything technical-related.
